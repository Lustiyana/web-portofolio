            This is a project aimed at creating a website for ordering credits
            and facilitating various payments. The website was developed using
            Next.js, utilizing the TypeScript programming language, and
            integrated with Tailwind CSS. In this project, my responsibility was
            to implement the UI design from Figma for the home page, about us,
            pricing, order tracking, and privacy policy sections. Additionally,
            I designed and implemented a custom select feature for the product
            purchase form.
